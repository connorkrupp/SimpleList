# SimpleList
iOS list app for testing frameworks and features such as iCloud, TouchID, etc.

### Why SimpleList?
This whole project is to implement loads of technologies (listed below). I just needed something simple that would allow me to practice all these features. I just don't want the app to be the center of attention, I want the implementation to fill that role.

### What is the goal?
I want to use as many components and features of Xcode, Swift, and debugging tools as I can to get as much practice as I can. Specifically, I want to practice best practices for iOS development. I don't want to cut any corners on this one.

### What technologies will you implement?
I plan to (eventually) support:

* iPhone
* iPad
* Apple Watch
* Mac OS X

So far I plan to use the following:

* UITableView
* UINavigationViewController
* UISplitViewController
* Force Touch!!!
* CoreData
* Localization
* Auto Layout
* iCloud
* TouchID Authentification
* Gestures
* Animations
* Visual Effects
* UI Testing
* xcassets
* Testing
* Debugging tools
* Insruments (wonderful tools)
* Protocols
* UIStackView
* Storyboard References?
* Maybe Continous Deployment?

I would like to get some sort of server running, too, but maybe that will be best saved for another project.
